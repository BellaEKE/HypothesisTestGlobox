A/B Test for an Ecommerce testing the effect of a new Homepage on Website
In this repo, we present the results of a randomized A/B test aimed at assessing 
the impact of promoting food and drink on Globox's website homepage. The test involved 
randomly displaying a promotional banner for food and drink on half of Globox's website 
visitors, while the other half was presented with the standard homepage. The test was 
conducted over a period of two weeks and gathered data on visitor engagement, click-through 
rates, and conversion rates.

Our analysis revealed that the promotional banner for food and drink had a significant impact 
on visitor engagement. Additionally, the banner led to an 18% increase in conversion rates, 
indicating that visitors were more likely to explore the food and drink section of the website
suggesting that promoting food and drink on the homepage can have a positive impact on 
sales. However, for the test period, there was no significant difference in the average amount 
spent by users and thus the impact on revenue was not observed.

Overall, our findings suggest that promoting food and drink on Globox's website homepage 
can be an effective strategy for increasing engagement, driving traffic, and boosting sales.
Further research is recommended to further transfer this increase in engagement to an 
increase in revenue. This report provides valuable insights for website designers and 
marketers looking to optimize their homepage content and improve their online performance
